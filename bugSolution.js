The solution is to completely rebuild the Android portion of your project.  This involves deleting the existing Android build files and letting Expo regenerate them.  If simply deleting the `android` directory and re-running `expo prebuild` does not resolve the problem, try the following:

1. **Delete the entire `android` folder:**  Use `rm -rf android` (on macOS/Linux) or `rmdir /s /q android` (on Windows).
2. **Run `expo prebuild`:** This command re-generates the Android project files.
3. **Run `expo build:android` again:** This time, the build should succeed due to a clean build environment and correctly configured Gradle/AGP versions. 

If the problem persists, further investigation of Gradle and AGP version compatibility might be necessary, potentially requiring manual adjustments within the project's `gradle` files.
