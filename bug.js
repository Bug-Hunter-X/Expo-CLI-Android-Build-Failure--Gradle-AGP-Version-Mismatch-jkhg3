This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The error message is vague and unhelpful, typically mentioning something about a build failure or an issue with the Android build tools.  The actual cause is often a mismatch between the versions of Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) used by the project and the versions expected by the Expo CLI or the Android build system.  This can happen even if the project's `gradle` and `gradlew` files seem correctly configured.  Sometimes, cleaning the project cache doesn't resolve the problem, and a complete rebuild from scratch is required.  The problem manifests more frequently when upgrading Expo versions or dependencies.
